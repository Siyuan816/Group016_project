# Call Analysis Project_Group 16
<h4>Description<br>
<h5>In this project, we firstly analyzed the top 10 incident types in our zip code area (10025) by using pandas.DataFrame. Firstly, we indicated our_zipcode variable be 10025. Then we created new_df using our_zipcode as a filter of df['Incident Zip']. We found the top 10 causes of calls to 311 and calculated the number of total incidents of each of these 10 types in our zip code area in the year 2020.
Then, we compared the proportion of illegal parking incidents in our zip code area with that in all zip code areas. The higher_parking_proportion was assigned to be False.
